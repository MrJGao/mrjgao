Hi there👋 My name is Xiaojie Gao (高孝杰). I'm currently a Postdoc fellow at Harvard Forest, Havard University, starting in August 2023. I am in the [Thompson Lab](https://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/jthompson) working on Long Term Ecological Research Program. I finished my Ph.D. at Center for Geospatial Analytics, North Carolina State University, working in the [Spatial Ecosystems Analytics Lab (SEAL)](https://ncsu-seal.netlify.app/). During my Ph.D. study, I was also a NASA Future Investigator working on using satellite 🛰 images to investigate plant phenology 🌱, which was my dissertation research.

:rocket: Passion: develop cool technologies to answer important science questions, and then share my knowledge to the whole world! 

:star: Keywords: Remote sensing; Climate change; Land surface phenology; Open science; Applied statistics; Bayesian

I play guitar :guitar: and I love singing :microphone:
